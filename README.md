# Overview
This project analyzes the data set attached in the zip folder. It invloves data cleaning, imputation, analysis and visualization to provide valuable insights for a business stakeholder to expand their business.

## Business Problem 
Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

## Data
The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. 

## Methods
This project aims to analyze the data, deal with missing values, data aggregation and visualization so as to help the organization make data driven decisions through the recommendations that we will provide.
It also aims to communicate about the data analysis process for better understanding of the analysis conducted.

## Results
Safe Models: The results below shows a list of **top 10 aircraft** models that have at most 1 incident count and 0 fatal injuries. These models appear to be the lowest risk
Unsafe Models: The results below shows a list of **top 10 aircraft** models that have highest fatalities and has their aircraft destroyed from the accident. These models appear to be the highest risk

## Recommendations
I have provided 3 recommendations to offer the business stakeholders.
- The focus should be to purchase aircraft models that have a history of zero fatalities and minimal damage and incidents such as `Airbus Industrie/A320`, etc. 
- Maintain proper weather monitoring to mitigate operational hazards.
- Provide proper training to the pilots to alert them on things that can affect various phase of flight and cause accidents therefore, preventing such occurences.
